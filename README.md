# Simple RPC Client for Discord Rich Presence

This is a simple RPC client for Discord Rich Presence. You need Python and a Discord bot to use it.

## Installation

### Using pip

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Run script:

### Keeping the Activity Alive
You might want to run some kind of virtual server to keep this activity running forever. A good example is AWS with a free tier Windows machine (0.5 GB of RAM and 1 core CPU). Install Discord on it and run this script.
